A clean, nice writing environment with new fonts. Will test four features:

- Writing lists
- Writing tables
- Writing and bringing in figures
- Spellcheckers and Grammar checkers
- Citations

## Notes on Writing Lists

One desirable feature would be to have the lists written first in single lines. Then, when I select the list and click on the list element on the top. If I do this, ideally, the editor should be able to put the list.
