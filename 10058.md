A clean, nice writing environment with new fonts. Will test four features:

- Writing lists
- Writing tables
- Writing and bringing in figures
- Spellcheckers and Grammar checkers
- Citations

## Notes on Writing Lists

One desirable feature would be to have the lists written first in single lines. Then, when I select the list and click on the list element on the top. If I do this, ideally, the editor should be able to put the list. It does not do so at the moment but if it were able to do that, it'd be great. I suppose that feature would be beneficial for all concerned as that would leave you free to first write everything in free text and then style the document as one wished rather than start with the element in the first place.
Also, if the items could be inserted with the "enter"/"return" at the end of each element, that'd be great.

## Notes on Writing Tables
Table is broken at this stage. Does not work. Needs to be fixed.

- The table cannot be inserted
- Once you write on a cell and the cell becomes gray, you are stuck. This cannot be edited back. 

> This is a quote

The quote command (that is ">" sign works), but the quote from the bread crumb does not work. Needs to be fixed. 

Citation works just fine.\cite{2015}
