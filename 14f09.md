## There is a problem with the Figure Environment
The first time you click the icon on the crumb to insert the figure environment, it works. But the problem is that, it does not allow a separate markdown text box to go along with the caption. The caption somehow magically appears and you will write in text to write in it. The problem that needs to be fixed next is if you want to then change the figure or rewrite the caption. it won

## How about links?
[Google](http://www.google.com)
Links work perfectly, thank you.

## How about formulae?

\(Y=\beta+\beta*x\)
Not bad, uses the Mathjax/Latex math. 

## Final Verdict at this stage:
- Some minor improvement needed.
- Otherwise great editor!
- Much better than what it has been. Spiffy, great font, great looks, and the figure insertion is much better.

I have some design gripes about citations, etc, otherwise, a great editor to play with. Still some changes to go befor prime time. Will write more on those.
