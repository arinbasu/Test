[Authorea's](http://www.authorea.com) new editor has a beautiful nice, pleasing, clean look. Works on every browser in the same way. From the top, you start with a good, clean editor bar. Automatically saves the writing. Great export features. The markdown editor works very responsively with Firefox when I tested. Will test with other browsers in other systems to see how it works. Three levels of headers. Quote, citation support (more on that later). Links, formula editor, three levels of writing environment support, LaTeX, Markdown, and HTML. All in all, several desirable features already in there. Love it.
