The table works just fine if you use a \LaTeX writing block but it does not work as well if you were to use the Markdown formatted writing environment. For most intent and purposes, a \LaTeX block is probably the best option to work wth the ne new wedit d edt editor of Authorea. Excelent effort and now with integration with \href{http://www.thewinn}{TheWinnower}
